        <p>
          Thank you for choosing Fictr. We organize esports tournaments and related events. Please read our
          refund policy carefully before registering or making any payments.
        </p>
        <h2>Event Registrations</h2>
        <p>
          All tournament registration fees are generally non-refundable once a team or player has registered. However,
          if an event is cancelled or significantly rescheduled by Fictr, you may be eligible for a full or partial
          refund. Any applicable refunds will be processed to the original payment method.
        </p>
        <h2>Disqualifications & No-shows</h2>
        <p>
          Disqualifications due to rule violations, incomplete teams, or no-shows are not eligible for refunds.
        </p>
        <h2>Technical Issues</h2>
        <p>
          If technical issues on Fictr-operated platforms prevent participation, we will evaluate on a case-by-case
          basis. Decisions may include rescheduling, credits for future events, or partial refunds where appropriate.
        </p>
        <h2>How to Request a Refund</h2>
